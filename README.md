This is my first static comp! It's about cows, and Bradley MOOper, but mostly cows. 
There are a ton of free cow images on the internet, and a lot of them are beautiful, like cows themselves.

This was my first forray into flexbox, a fun and fantastic tool. It actually wasn't as challenging as I thought it may be, given that it's a new technology to me. 

My main issue came from the fact that my dev tools were not actually giving me an accurate representation of what the site would look like on mobile devices, but by hooking my phone up to my computer and using Safari dev tools (ick!), I was able to find a solution that worked for both platforms. 

Unfortunately in doing so I had to create two breakpoints in my CSS, rather than just the one, which I preferred. It was just impossible to get my image to work perfectly in those two scenarios, so I had to resize it for the intermediate state. 

The comp was based on this image, found at the assignment page: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

Here is what my final page ended up looking like on desktop and mobile.
